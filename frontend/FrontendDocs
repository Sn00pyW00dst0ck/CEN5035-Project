The frontend has two primary pages: the Login Page and the Main Page.

# Login
The login page consists of two forms: Username and Password. Currently, only the Username box must be filled to permit login as credentials have not been implemented. Upon sign in, a query is sent to the backend to fetch the user's data, before switching to the main page.
We also intend to add a Register page in which the user can create a new account.

# Main
This is where the user will spend most of their time. It displays the user's groups, channels, messages, etc.

***Basic Anatomy***
The main page is broken into two primary components: the Group List and the Active Server.

***Group List***
Consists of the user's info, a server search bar, and a list of all the servers the client is in. When a server is selected, it becomes the 'active server'.
