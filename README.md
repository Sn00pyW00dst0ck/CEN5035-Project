## Project Description

Numerous communication platforms currently exist to allow groups to communicate effectively and rapidly. Being that they often rely upon centralized servers to store and transmit user messages, they require great funding. Many of these platforms decide to gain this funding by selling user data/analytics. Our solution ***Sector*** proposes the implementation of p2p technologies to provide users with an end-to-end encrypted solution in which no user data is stored anywhere except on user devices. With this solution, users will be able to create group chats in which all participating members contain a complete record of all messages.
