Backend
Key Implementations
Authentication System

JWT Authentication: Implemented a robust JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication system with secure token generation, validation, and management.
Challenge-Response Authentication: Developed a secure challenge-response mechanism for user login using public key cryptography.
Session Management: Created comprehensive session handling with token expiration and refresh capabilities.

Encryption

End-to-End Encryption Support: Implemented backend support for end-to-end encrypted messaging.
Key Management: Developed secure storage and retrieval of user public keys for message encryption.
Message Integrity: Added verification mechanisms to ensure message integrity during transmission.

Database Enhancements

Optimized Queries: Improved database query performance for faster message and channel retrieval.
Data Consistency: Enhanced data consistency checks when performing create, update, and delete operations.
Relationship Management: Strengthened relationship handling between users, groups, channels, and messages.

API Improvements

Standardized Responses: Implemented consistent API response formats across all endpoints.
Error Handling: Enhanced error reporting and handling for more informative client feedback.
Documentation: Updated API documentation with comprehensive endpoint descriptions and example usage.
