# Sprint 4

## Frontend

### Integration with Backend Endpoints and Furthered Unit Testing

#### Overview
In Sprint 4, we focused primarily on continued integration with the backend. This includes logging in, registration page, adding new servers, messaging across peers, fetching user groups, fetching group channels, and creating new group channels. We also added more unit and cypress tests to ensure that future changes will not inadvertently cause component failures. In addition, the following changes to the interface were made:

- Initial login screen rendering has been enhanced
- User registration page
- Successful login with credentials
- Can create new servers
- Server and Channel Interaction for newly created servers
- Displaying server list after authentication
- Server selection and channel display
- Adding new channels to existing servers and to new servers
- Switching between channels across various servers
- Can post messages
- Can recieve messages
- Verifying correct message display for selected channels
- User profile management, can edit user status, Name, and description
- Servers and channels exist in the same state and messages are displayed appropriately for each selected channels

## Frontend Documentation

The frontend has two primary pages: the Login Page and the Main Page.

## Login
The login page consists of two forms: Username and Password. Currently, only the Username box must be filled to permit login as credentials have not been implemented. Upon sign in, a query is sent to the backend to fetch the user's data, before switching to the main page. We also added a Register page in which the user can create a new account.

## Main
This is where the user will spend most of their time. It displays the user's groups, channels, messages, etc.

***Basic Anatomy***  
The main page is broken into two primary components: the Group List and the Active Server.

***Group List***  
Consists of the user's info, a server search bar, and a list of all the servers the client is in. Users can create a new server using the text field and submission button at the bottom of the component. When a group is selected, it becomes the 'active server'. In addition, a new component window pops up revealing all of the channels of a server. A second text field and submission button are generated to allow users to create new channels.

***Active Group***
Holds the messages of a selected channel in addition to a menu bar and member list. Once a group is selected, a menu on the right side of the component can be opened to reveal all of its members. A top bar also exists allowing for easy channel-switching and message filtering.
